          My name is Annette Kang. In my spare time I like to go rock climbing or do any physical activity ranging from hiking, lifting weights, or tumbling. My previous job experience has been minimal but I am always looking for new opportunities to widen my perspective in the business field. I have worked at a Poke store as a server  and cashier for over a year while I was in high school. I am currently a freshman in college and so that job shows that  I am very good  at time management. Working in the food industry has also allowed me to realize  that  I work well with people and know how to handle complaints and requests  from customers. I also currently volunteer at a nursery where I have to take care  of kids. This allows me to bring a positive attitude into any work space I am put in  as  kids  require having a positive attitude at all times. It also shows my patience with people and allows me to understand the mindsets of parents as well as  children. This allows me to have a bigger audience that I can appeal to and contribute to  ideas  concerning parents and kids. My  range of work is very limited but diverse and shows that I am quick to adapt into any environment I am put in. I have also helped and contributed my efforts into planning events for a big organization. Every summer, the church I attend holds a huge event for kids called VBS that ends up catering to over five hundred kids. I help  plan the event along with a team of people and we decide everything from the theme of the event, what the decorations will be like, to what food we are going to serve to the kids. We have to make a schedule for the kids as well as come up with various activities the kids can do each day since the event is a four-day long event. With every activity we decide to do, I do the activity myself to make sure it is not too difficult for the kids and if it is safe to do. Along with planning the event, I also am one of the leaders in the event who help take care of the kids and make sure that we are doing all the activities according to schedule. This shows that I have leadership abilities as I am able to facilitate the activities of multiple kids. It also shows that I have strong communication skills as I have to break down rules and instructions to kids well enough for them to understand the instructions, as well as being firm enough  to make sure the kids follow instructions but not overly so that they get upset and start to rebel. Working with kids also taught me to have an open mind as well as strong abilities in flexibility because  working with kids sometimes requires going off task a little bit in order to get through all  the activities  since kids are  active and have  shorter attention spans. <br><br>
